# OpenGLLightingFractals | Created: November 2021
A fractal is a never-ending, opr increasingly complex pattern. I coded a few examples in this code and included lighting to better showcase the fractals. The fractals I coded are 3D Sierpinski triangle and Menger Sponge. In addition, I have also included a scene that shows multiple 3D shapes to showcase the lighting on different objects.

The following gif shows the 3D Sierpinski Triangle:

The following gif shows the 3D Menger Sponge:

The following gif shows the scene with multiple 3D shapes:

A Sphere is also included in one of the scenes, but the gif created is too long to include on GitHub.
